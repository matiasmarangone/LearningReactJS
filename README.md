# Contact

Authorization Form
A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.

They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, you’ll accomplish this by using a React component to set up a simple authorization layer.

# Random Color Picker

Our program will set the screen’s background to a random color. Clicking a button will refresh to a new, random color.

# Video Player

For this project, we’ll make three React components work together to create a responsive video player.
